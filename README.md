# Pig-Game-by-M-Afzaal-Afzal
Pig game is just like a ludo game. The player who score 100 first will win. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold": If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues
